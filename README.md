Romadeva
========


It is a simple rule based transliteration tool to convert Roman script to indic(Devanagari) script. As most Keyboards are English and to write in Indic script is difficult. It is easy to write Hindi in roman script this gives inspiration to make a tool for Linux to write hindi text easily

## Requirements ##
* For Backend-source you would need only gcc compiler and support for unicodes
* For GUI-source you would need Gambas tool(A visual basic kind of tool for Linux)

## How to use ##

* For Backend-source use makefile to compile and run it using <p>
$./translpsl "Meraa Bhaarat Mahaan"<p> 
Output: मेरा भारत महान
* You can also install this tool using romadeva_0.0.33-1_amd64.deb (only for 64 bit systems), to test it out

## Disclaimer ##

This is a really old code(and I don't maintain it now, but still you can report any issue), I have just moved the repositories from https://code.google.com/p/romadeva to GitHub.<p>
On Google codes(and sourceforge) it was downloaded more than 1700 times (just bragging). Also that this project is listed in Gambas official application repositories here: http://gambasdoc.org/help/app
