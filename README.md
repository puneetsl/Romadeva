Romadeva
========

It is a simple tool to convert Roman script to indic(Devanagari) script. As most Keyboards are English and to write in Indic script is difficult. It is easy to write Hindi in roman script this gives inspiration to make a tool for Linux to write hindi text easily
So basically this is a simple offline english to hindi transliteration tool.

## Requirements ##
* For Backend-source you would need only gcc compiler and support for unicodes
* For GUI-source you would need Gambas tool(A visual basic kind of tool for Linux)

## How to use ##

* For Backend-source use makefile to compile and run it using 
$./translpsl "Meraa Bhaarat Mahaan"
* You can also install this tool using romadeva_0.0.33-1_amd64.deb, to test it out

## Disclaimer ##

This is a really old code(and I don't maintain it now), I have just moved the repositories from https://code.google.com/p/romadeva to GitHub.
On Google codes it was downloaded more than 1300 times(just bragging).
